# apres-ski
Define development environments in containers.  Take them with you wherever you go.

Why "apres-ski"?  These environments are built on Alpine, what else is there to do in the Alps!
Well not exactly... I always start tring to put a language toolchain together on alpine but sometimes give up and go off-piste.

## Building environments

To build each environment, navigate to its directory, and run `./build`
